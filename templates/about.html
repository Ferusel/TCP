            <p> This website is a webcrawler for food recipes, scrapped from three websites <i>(see footer)</i>.
                Somtimes, it's pretty inconvenient to find a recipe, only to learn you don't have all the ingredients
                for it. Using this website, you can specify recipes for ingredients that you <i>do</i> have, which makes
                things more convenient!<br><br>

                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I do NOT own any recipes you find here. As mentioned, I scrapped them from
                the websites. All recipes belong to the owners that wrote them!</p>

            <legend id="legend-2">Where did this come from?</legend>
            <p>The Crock Pot is a project that I embarked on after learning <i>very basic</i> web development from <a
                    href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">Harvard's CS50 Course</a>,
                and acts as my final project for the course. As countries worldwide entered various stages of lockdown
                during the COVID-19 Pandemic, carrying out daily routines such as cooking and grocery shopping became
                increasingly difficult and expensive. I realized there was a need to maximize and stretch the food we
                had at home, but I found it troublesome to trawl through recipe after recipe to find one that I could
                actually cook, thus The Crock Pot was born.<br><br>

                Although still in its early stages, I do think this website has potential to be something. As I continue
                improving on its functions and (hopefully) not get sued by the websites I'm scraping from, I hope to
                create something that will be useful to everyone, as we continue battling against the COVID-19 Pandemic
                (and food waste in general!).<br><br>

                As I was researching on this problem, I came across this <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/f0qjm9/what_the_coronavirus_forcing_me_in_lockdowns/">
                    reddit post</a> that highlighted the problem I mentioned, but at the extremes. I hope things improve
                soon.

            <legend id="legend-1">Hey, your website sucks!</legend>
            <p> Owing to my general inexperience at coding, with The Crock Pot being my first <i>serious</i> project
                learning code from the ground-up, I recognize I have much to learn. Yes, as of writing, my website
                sucks. In fact, I don't think anyone would even use this thing. I don't even know why I'm writing this
                About page <i>(but if you're here, I'm grateful for the company)</i>. <br><br>

                Nevertheless, I will steadily improve my skills, and I hope to improve upon The Crock Pot steadily.
                <strong>If you wish to criticize my work and help me improve, you can do so <a href="#">here</a>. I
                    gladly appreciate it!</strong></p>

            <p>Scattered throughout this site, I would like to say it once more: <strong>I do NOT own any recipes on
                    this site!</strong> I just scraped them from Allrecipes, SeriousEats, and Foodnetwork <i>Links in
                    Footer</i>.<br><br>

                To create the website, I used the Python Flask framework, along with basic HTML/CSS, and used Bootstrap
                to beautify the site.</p>
